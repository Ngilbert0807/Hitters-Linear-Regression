This report explores an old publicly avalalible dataset with a number of baseball statistics as well as their salaries.
Using R I preform exploratory data analysis, to try and identify trends within the data attempting to find key predictors of a players salary.
I then train a linear regression model, diaganosing and resolving multiple violations in the model, eventually finishing with a trained linear regression model.
I utilized R markdown to turn the raw code into a readable report for ease of viewing for people not familiar with R.
